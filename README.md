if you already have an account, go to this link now  
[https://tryhackme.com/r/room/adventofcyber2024](url)

read all the rooms (from Task1 untill Task6), you will understand the concept of the challenges, story and everything !!
If you don't have the effort to read and understand yourself and you're waiting for others to give you everything , then IT in general isn't for you !!

## Important Notes about this repository

1. The repository is organised by days : from day 1 to day 24
2. In every day, you won't find ready solutions or answers of questions, this is not a detailed writeup, this is my personal notes on every challenge
3. Feel free to help me to make these notes better by fixing errors, or any issues or adding some notes, I'll be happy
